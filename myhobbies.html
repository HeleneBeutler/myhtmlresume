<h1>my hobbies</h1>
<p>
    I love learning new languages. I already master French (mother language), English (fluent), German (fluent, I've been leaving in Germany for 3 years now) and Italian (I was lucky enough to study in Venice and Milan, both in english and italian languages)<br>
    Programming is kind of a new language too, and indeed I'm enjoying myself learning it !

    I've been more and more involved in the Kindergarden, helping organizing sommer parties and beeing the link between parents and educators.

literature, self development, inspirational stories, education and children related books
